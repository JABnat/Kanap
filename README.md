This is the front end and back end server for Project 5 of the Web Developer path.

The project mission was to successfully integrate a new website for Kanap, a sofa brand that sells its products exclusively in its store. They want to have an e-commerce platform in addition to their physical store.

We were assigned to use the programming language `JavaScript` to display the api, develop a functioning cart to add, subtract and maintain values of the sofas, as well as collect user contact information. 

### Back end Prerequisites ###

I installed Node and `npm` locally on my computer.

### Back end Installation ###

The backend repo was cloned. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`. I then  
ran the server with `node server`.
